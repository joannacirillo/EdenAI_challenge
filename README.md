# EdenAI_challenge

This repository is made to present the code of a challenge for a simple web app.

#Front-end
The front end is made with both Typescript and Vue.js for managing the pages and the components. For some features like buttons, I used Bootstrap-vue to have a nice display.
The retrieving of the datas from the back-office is made with axios.

#Back-end
The back-end is made with Python using Django. I used also Django REST Framework to create the API that allows to send data from the database to the front-end.
The database system is sqlite3, as it is a simple way to manage some data with Django.
